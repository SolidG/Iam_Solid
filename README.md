MILLION MONEY

WHAT IS MILLION MONEY?

MILLION.MONEY can be divided into 2 concepts:

First: Is a smart contract or cryptocurrency network application on Ethereum. The application code is programmed to distribute incoming transfers among participants according to a specific algorithm.

Second - This is the site itself, providing an interface for the convenience of working with a smart contract.

WHO IS THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATOR?

In this project of Million.Money there is no administrator. There is a creator who uploaded the contract code to the cryptocurrency blockchain Ethereum. Since then, the smart contract has been part of the overall network, which is supported by miners.
No one has the right to affect the operation of a smart contract, delete it or stop it. Any attempt to make unauthorized changes will be rejected due to inconsistency with previous copies in the block chain.
